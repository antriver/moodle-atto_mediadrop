## Background

[Media**Drop**](http://mediadrop.net/) (previously known as "MediaCore Community Edition" / "MediaCore CE") is a free, open source, self-hosted, video sharing platform.

[Media**Core**](http://www.mediacore.com/) is a paid-for, cloud-based service. It started as a fork of the open source version but is now very different and incompatible.

MediaCore provide plugins for Moodle at https://github.com/mediacore/mediacore-moodle

The Atto plugin provided by MediaCore is not compatible with MediaDrop. Previously you could use an old version of their plugin with the TinyMCE editor (https://github.com/mediacore/mediacore-moodle/tree/fe40bf8df4) but that is now not compatible with the latest version of Moodle.

The filter plugin provided by MediaCore **is** compatible with MediaDrop at the time of writing and is recommended alongside this plugin.

## Credits

This plugin is heavily based on the [old mediacoreinsert plugin provided by MediaCore](https://github.com/mediacore/mediacore-moodle/tree/fe40bf8df4).
